# Projects
awards:
- title: Customer Churn Analysis 
  # url: https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning
  date: '2024-09-01'
  # awarder: 'June 2023 - August 2023'
  summary: |
    - Led a comprehensive customer churn analysis using Python, analyzing data from over 7,000 customer records to identify key factors influencing churn rates. 
    - Applied the SMOTE method to increase sample size and developed multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict potential customer churn. Achieved an accuracy of 0.9 using XGBoost and created SHAP value charts to explain the model. 
    - Designed and implemented A/B testing to validate data-driven strategies for reducing customer churn, comparing pre- and post-intervention churn rates to measure the effectiveness of the campaign. 

- title: Traffic Flow Modeling
  url: https://github.com/wylwswswws/Traffic-Flow-Modeling
  date: '2024-04-01'
  awarder: University of Nottingham
  summary: |
    - Developed and implemented traffic flow models, including cellular automata, car-following models, and partial differential equations (PDE), to simulate realistic traffic dynamics across various densities and driver behaviors.
    - Conducted extensive simulations to assess the impact of different traffic densities and road conditions, optimizing model parameters for enhanced predictive accuracy.
    - Analyzed and identified optimal density levels and behavioral factors that aligned closely with real-world traffic patterns, providing recommendations to improve flow and reduce congestion.
