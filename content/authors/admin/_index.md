# Projects
awards:
  - title: Customer Churn Analysis 
    # url: https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning
    #date_start: '2024-06-01'
    #date_end: '2024-08-01'
    #date: '2024-06-01'
    awarder: 'June 2023 - August 2023'
    summary: |
      - Led a comprehensive customer churn analysis using Python, analyzing data from over 7,000 customer records to identify key factors influencing churn rates. 
      - Applied the SMOTE method to increase sample size and developed multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict potential customer churn. Achieved an accuracy of 0.9 using XGBoost and created SHAP value charts to explain the model. 
      -  Designed and implemented A/B testing to validate data-driven strategies for reducing customer churn, comparing pre- and post-intervention churn rates to measure the effectiveness of the campaign. 
  - title: Dimension Reduction Analysis
